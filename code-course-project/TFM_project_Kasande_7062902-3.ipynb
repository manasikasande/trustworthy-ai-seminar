        "Testing Large Language Models (LLMs) prior to their deployment is critical for ensuring they are reliable and trustworthy in diverse applications. In the context of LLMs, red teaming provides a scalable approach for uncovering vulnerabilities, such as by searching for prompts that yield harmful or toxic outputs. Traditional red teaming frameworks were human-in-the-loop: humans act as red teamers who evaluate a target LLM by adversarially prompting or interacting with the model. One drawback of these frameworks is that they require considerable human effort to perform rigorous, systematic, and structured testing.\n",

Instead of relying on humans, these strategies are based on LLM-based red teamers and are described by the following three steps:\n",

        "As the content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) proliferates, it is critical to keep track of it and be able to distinguish it from user generated content. In the context of LLM, watermarking aims to embed specific patterns or markers within the output of the model. This enables us to identify the model’s outputs, and in turn, trace the usage of the generated content. There are two key properties that are important to satisfy when it comes to watermarking. First, it is important that watermarks do not reduce the perceptual quality of the intended output, i.e., they should be invisible. Second, for a given text that was watermarked, it should be easy to detect a watermark, while hard to remove it without significantly altering the text.\n"
